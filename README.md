# MYportfolio_Public

I built my portfolio website to showcase my projects, skills, and experience as a Software Developer. The site is developed using JavaScript, Python, CSS, and integrates a database to manage dynamic content.
ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack:

âœ” Frontend: JavaScript, CSS
âœ” Backend: Python (Flask/Django)
âœ” Database: SQL (PostgreSQL)

The website features a contact form connected to a cloud database, allowing me to manage inquiries efficiently. It's designed to be responsive, fast, and easy to navigate, providing a seamless experience for visitors.
